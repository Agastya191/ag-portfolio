    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I am a 10th grade student at Lambert High School with a deep interest in
      artificial intelligence, biomedical research, and building systems that
      remove friction in healthcare access. I focus on transforming complex,
      real-world problems into scalable AI-driven solutions.

    <div class="feature-block">
      <h3>Iddu AI — Autonomous Healthcare Agent</h3>
      <p>
        Iddu AI is an autonomous AI system that calls doctors’ offices, navigates
        phone trees, and schedules appointments on behalf of patients—reducing
        anxiety and eliminating access barriers in healthcare.
